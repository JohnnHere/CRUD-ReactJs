As you guys can see, it has a simple and intuitive layout. We can register the basic informations in the 'New Blog' section and organize them in the 'Home' section.

The idea of this project is that it will be my personal repository for my own stories. When this time comes, it will be acessible on live.

The technologies used for this project were: Javascript and React.js.
